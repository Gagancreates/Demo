Overview:

Over the past two months, our Oracle database has faced several issues requiring the coordinated efforts of our Production Engineering, Application, and DBA/Unix DevOps teams. These issues have impacted the payment status system, with a minor impact on a small percentage of transactions. Below is a detailed report outlining the issues encountered, the actions taken, the impact observed, and the lessons learned.

1. RMAN Backup Running Very Frequently
Issue:
The RMAN (Recovery Manager) backup was scheduled to run more frequently than necessary, causing high I/O and CPU usage.

Impact:

Delays in processing payment status updates during backup periods.
Minor impact on overall system performance.
Actions Taken:

Reviewed and optimized the RMAN backup schedule to balance the need for data protection with system performance.
Implemented incremental backups to reduce the load on the system.
Learnings:

Regularly review and adjust backup schedules according to the current load and business requirements.
Implement monitoring tools to detect and alert on excessive backup activities.
2. Housekeeping Job Extended Beyond Its Time Frame
Issue:
Housekeeping jobs, including tasks like deleting old logs and archiving data, were running longer than their allocated time frame, causing resource contention.

Impact:

Delays in processing certain transactions due to resource contention.
Slight degradation in system performance during housekeeping operations.
Actions Taken:

Analyzed and optimized the housekeeping scripts to run more efficiently.
Rescheduled housekeeping jobs to run during off-peak hours.
Learnings:

Regularly review and optimize housekeeping jobs.
Ensure sufficient resources are allocated for these jobs during their execution.
3. Sequence Limit Breach in Oracle
Issue:
A sequence limit breach occurred, causing disruptions in the generation of unique identifiers.

Impact:

Temporary disruption in processing transactions requiring unique identifiers.
Approx. 0.01% of transactions affected, leading to delays in payment status updates for a few consumers.
Actions Taken:

Increased the sequence limits and implemented monitoring to alert when sequences approach their limits.
Reviewed and optimized the sequence generation logic to ensure it scales with usage.
Learnings:

Monitor sequence usage closely and set alerts for early detection of potential breaches.
Regularly review and update sequence configurations to accommodate growth.
4. Monthly Weekend Maintenance and Concurrent Index Alteration
Issue:
The scheduled monthly weekend maintenance coincided with a large ALTER INDEX query, leading to resource contention and performance degradation.

Impact:

Significant delay in processing during the maintenance window.
Delays in payment status updates and remittance processing for some consumers.
Actions Taken:

Rescheduled the index alteration query to a different time to avoid conflict with the maintenance window.
Improved coordination between teams to avoid scheduling conflicts.
Learnings:

Enhance communication and coordination between teams to prevent overlapping resource-intensive tasks.
Implement a change management process that includes a review of scheduled tasks to avoid conflicts.
5. Large Database and Increased Traffic
Issue:
The database size and the volume of traffic increased significantly, leading to performance bottlenecks.

Impact:

Occasional delays in payment status updates due to high traffic.
Slight increase in processing time for a small percentage of transactions.
Actions Taken:

Scaled up database resources, including CPU and memory, to handle the increased load.
Optimized database queries and indexing strategies to improve performance.
Learnings:

Continuously monitor and scale resources in response to traffic patterns and database growth.
Regularly review and optimize queries and indexing to maintain performance.
6. Network Card Using Bond1 with 1GB Capacity
Issue:
The network card bonded interface (bond1) with a 1GB capacity became a bottleneck under heavy traffic conditions.

Impact:

Occasional network delays affecting transaction processing and payment status updates.
Approx. 0.01% of transactions experienced delays in remittance processing.
Actions Taken:

Upgraded the network interface to a higher capacity (10GB) to accommodate increased traffic.
Implemented network traffic monitoring to ensure optimal performance.
Learnings:

Regularly review network capacity and upgrade as needed to support growing traffic demands.
Implement proactive network monitoring to detect and resolve bottlenecks early.
Conclusion
Over the past two months, we have encountered several issues that have tested the resilience of our Oracle database and the capabilities of our teams. Despite the challenges, our teams managed to mitigate these issues without major disruptions, affecting only about 0.01% of transactions, with minor delays in payment status updates and remittance processing. The lessons learned will guide us in preventing similar issues in the future and ensuring the continued stability and performance of our systems.

We appreciate the hard work and dedication of all teams involved and look forward to continued collaboration in maintaining and improving our database systems.
